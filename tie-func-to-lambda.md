Absolutely, let's recreate the message with the updated directory structure and include the command to zip each Lambda function:

### AWS Infrastructure Setup and Lambda Function Deployment

Given your project structure for `license-server`, you'll first need to create a ZIP file for each Lambda function in the `lambda-functions` directory. Here's how you can do that:

#### Zipping Lambda Functions

Navigate to your project's root directory (`license-server`) and execute the following commands to create ZIP files for each Lambda function:

```bash
cd license-server/lambda-functions

for dir in */ ; do
    func_name=${dir%/}  # Extract the function name from the directory name
    cd "$func_name"
    zip -r "../${func_name}.zip" .
    cd ..
done
```

This script will create a ZIP file for each function in the respective directory under `lambda-functions`. For example, `activateLicense.zip`, `createLicense.zip`, etc.

#### Creating an Amazon RDS Instance

You can create an Amazon RDS instance using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --db-instance-class db.t2.micro \
    --engine postgres \
    --allocated-storage 20 \
    --master-username licenseusr \
    --master-user-password [PASSWORD] \
    --backup-retention-period 3 \
    --no-publicly-accessible
```

Replace `[PASSWORD]` with a secure password.

#### Deploying Lambda Functions

After zipping the functions, you can create each Lambda function with a command similar to the following:

```bash
cd ..

for zip in lambda-functions/*.zip; do
    func_name=$(basename "$zip" .zip)
    aws lambda create-function \
        --function-name "$func_name" \
        --runtime python3.8 \
        --role arn:aws:iam::[ACCOUNT_ID]:role/lambda-role \
        --handler "${func_name}.lambda_handler" \
        --zip-file "fileb://${zip}"
done
```

Replace `[ACCOUNT_ID]` with your AWS account ID and ensure the role exists with the necessary permissions.

#### Configuring API Gateway

Setting up API Gateway is usually more complex and may require multiple steps that are more efficiently done through the AWS Management Console. However, the initial steps to create an API can be performed using the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Create an API
api_id=$(aws apigateway create-rest-api --name 'LicenseServerAPI' --query 'id' --output text)

# The next steps would involve creating resources and methods for each endpoint
```

This will create a new REST API. You'll need to add resources, methods, and integrate them with the corresponding Lambda functions.

These steps outline the initial process for setting up your AWS infrastructure for the `license-server` project. Remember, additional configuration and permissions setup will be required, especially for the Lambda functions to interact with RDS and for the API Gateway to properly route requests to these functions.Absolutely, let's recreate the message with the updated directory structure and include the command to zip each Lambda function:
